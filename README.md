ServiceNow Applications Development Bootcamp & Hackathon 

Developed a Loanerâ€™s Request Application in bootcamp in which the application manages and tracks Loaner Requests through an easy-to-use user interface that is consistent with other corporate software.

During the hackathon with a team of 3 other students, over the course of a day and a half, we developed a Travel Reimbursement Management Application to eliminate having to scramble for receipts and go through a financial audit through the company. The application contains access controls, security, UI policies/actions, and client/server scripting.
